# Skyler Prowten - Data Analytics Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Skyler! I have a technical background and hold a Master of Arts (M.A.) degree in Experimental Psychology from Appalachian State University. Throughout my master's program, I was involved in numerous research projects where my responsibilities included data analysis and modeling as well as interpretation. Before enrollment in the program, I graduated from North Carolina State University with a B.A. in Psychology and a B.S. in Animal Science.
